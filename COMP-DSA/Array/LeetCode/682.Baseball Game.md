You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

You are given a list of strings `operations`, where `operations[i]` is the `ith` operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

- An integer `x`.
    - Record a new score of `x`.
- `'+'`.
    - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
- `'D'`.
    - Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
- `'C'`.
    - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.

Return _the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations_.

The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a **32-bit** integer and that all operations are valid.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
**Output:** 30
**Explanation:**
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
"2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
"D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
"+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].
The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= operations.length <= 1000`
- `operations[i]` is `"C"`, `"D"`, `"+"`, or a string representing an integer in the range `[-3 * 104, 3 * 104]`.
- For operation `"+"`, there will always be at least two previous scores on the record.
- For operations `"C"` and `"D"`, there will always be at least one previous score on the record.

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
	int calPoints(vector<string>& operations) {
	
		stack<int> stack;
		int sum = 0;

		for (int i = 0; i < operations.size(); i++) {
			if (operations[i] == "+") {
				int first = stack.top();
				stack.pop();
				int second = stack.top();
				stack.push(first);
				stack.push(first + second);
				sum += first + second;
			} else if (operations[i] == "D") {
				sum += stack.top() * 2;
				stack.push(stack.top() * 2);
			} else if (operations[i] == "C") {
				sum -= stack.top();
				stack.pop();
			} else {
				sum += stoi(operations[i]);
				stack.push(stoi(operations[i]));
			}
		}
		return sum;
	}
};
```
